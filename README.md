Rental Film


There is a film rental store that provides DVDs on a rental basis. The owner of this store is your friend and he is not at all computer savvy. To manage his business he has software that helps him to manage the business. 
He also has one helper who understands computers well and as a part-time job, he manages the software and helps the owner by providing different types of reports using SQL queries. 
Today, unfortunately, this helper is not available. So your friend has called you to help him with some of the reports that he needs to make important business decisions.
